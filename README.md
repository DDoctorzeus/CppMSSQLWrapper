# CppMSSQLWrapper
A Microsoft SQL Server (msodbcsql) Client Wrapper For (C++)

I created this project for use in another application due to the lack of wrappers for C++ that are easy to use and can be used asynchronously accross threads. 

Note that this is only a wrapper and you need to download msodbcsql.

I might add some formal documentation for this at some point (depending on demand) however for now look at the main.cpp in the Example folder.

I may make also make a c version of it later.
